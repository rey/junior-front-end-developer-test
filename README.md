This is a test that a potential junior front end developer has to solve. There is no _right answer_ although there is broken markup, an inefficient stylesheet and a laughable design.

## Instructions

This is a web page about J Dilla, the legendary record producer.

Your task is to clone the `junior-front-end-developer-test` repo and make it a web page worthy of Dilla's timeless beats.

Your resulting page should take into account the following:

1. There are many things wrong with the HTML.
2. There are many things wrong with the CSS.
3. The page is not currently responsive.

_Any approach is fine. Feel free to throw it away and start again if you feel like it._

## Bonus points

1. Use of a responsive framework
2. Use of typeface libraries
3. Improve the web page's usability and make it visually pleasing


## If using HAML/SASS

1. `cd junior-front-end-developer-test`
2. `bundle install`
3. `foreman start`
