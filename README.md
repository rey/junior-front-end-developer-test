This is a test that a potential junior front end developer has to solve

# Instructions

This is a web page about J Dilla, the legendary record producer.

Your task is to clone the `junior-front-end-developer-test` repo and make it a web page worthy of Dilla's timeless beats.

Your resulting page should take into account the following:

1. There are many things wrong with the HTML. Fix the markup!
2. There are many things wrong with the CSS. Fix the stylesheet!
3. The page is not currently responsive. Make it so!

## Bonus points

1. Use of a responsive framework
2. Use of typeface libraries
3. Improve the web page's usability


# If going down the HAML/SASS route then here's how to get started

1. `bundle install`
2. `foreman start`
