## Points of note

* Uses HAML/SASS. Candidate doesn't have to use these but impress if so
* `index.html` has lots of _bad_ markup including but not limited to `<center>`, `<br>` and not using HTML 5 page markup
* That video auto plays which is annoying
* No doctype or language
* Use of mad markup for quotes
* Use of inline styles
* Floats arent cleared
* Unused or pointless style rules in CSS

Basically this is a sh_t sandwich of a web page and should be thrown away and rebuilt using a responsive framework.

## Possible solutions

### Bronze award

* Goes through the HTML/CSS and fixes invalid markup/styles.
* Makes attempt to make markup/styles valid and sane
* Makes attempt to make the page visually pleasing and usable. At the very least they should remove that bloody autoplay
* Other things of that ilk

Summary: takes what they're given and fixes the bits that are invalid/broken

### Silver award

* Goes through the HTML/CSS/HAML/SASS and fixes invalid markup/styles. A fair bit of the markup/styles will have been removed or rewritten.
* Makes a half decent attempt to make the page visually pleasing and usable.
* Have used or had a go at using external tools/libraries
* Will have a reasonable amount of responsiveness, maybe

Summary: looks at the web page and has a go at crafting an improvement. If they haven't used HAML/SASS before they might give it a crack.

### Gold award

* They will have taken a look at the HTML/CSS/HAML/SASS, given a hollow laugh and set about rebuilding the web page in their own image
* Will have used HTML/CSS/HAML/SASS in combination with a responsive framework like Skeleton or Susy to make a killer responsive web page befitting of J Dilla
* Will be able to give reasons why they chose the tools for the task and how they came to their design decisions

Summary: This is a person who knows what the crack is.
